# Bank-Locker-Security-System
### Mini Project SEM III
In this project, we are designing advanced banking security systems that ensure genuine access to the safe deposit box and prevent all abuses.
As we know that security has become very important in this developing world. Everyone has valuable accessories such as gold, jewelry or cash. It is not enough to own these items, but the security of these items is very important, and for this purpose we keep them in safe deposit boxes.
Nevertheless, we often hear or read in the newspapers that a fake person has gained access to another person's safe deposit box and stolen money. To prevent this kind of fraud,
authentication of the person who wants to use the safe deposit box is very important. In this project, we are designing advanced banking security systems that ensure genuine access to the safe deposit box and prevent all abuses
